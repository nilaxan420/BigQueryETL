E-Commerce Data Pipeline Documentation
Overview
The E-Commerce Data Pipeline is a project that aims to design and implement a data pipeline for an e-commerce platform. The pipeline extracts data from multiple sources, performs necessary transformations, and loads the processed data into a target database. The project leverages Python, Pandas, MySQL, and Matplotlib to accomplish these tasks.

Project Steps
Understanding the Problem and Requirements

Defined the scope of the project and identified the data sources.
Explored the structure of the data and determined the necessary transformations.
Understood the target database schema.
Setting Up the Environment

Installed the required software, including Python, Pandas, MySQL, and Matplotlib.
Created an account on the MySQL database server.
Data Collection

Obtained the e-commerce data from a public dataset or created mock data.
Ensured the dataset included user details, product details, and transaction data.
Data Transformation and Loading

Used Pandas to transform the data, including converting data types and performing calculations.
Established a connection to the MySQL database.
Created a table in the database to store the transformed data.
Inserted the transformed data into the database table.
Calculation of Total Sales by Category

Wrote a Python script to query the database and calculate the total sales for each category.
Retrieved the results from the database.
Printed the results to validate the calculations.
Visualization of Sales by Category

Developed a separate Python script using Matplotlib to visualize the total sales by category.
Extracted the category and total sales data from the calculation results.
Plotted a bar chart to represent the sales by category.
